# On average, he responds to 1 request every 2.5 hours.
# In this exercise, you'll calculate probabilities of different amounts of time passing between 
# Amir receiving a lead and sending a response.

# Import expon from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import expon

# Print probability response takes < 1 hour
print(expon.cdf(1, scale=2.5))

# Print probability response takes > 4 hours
print(1 - expon.cdf(4, scale=2.5)) #scale = (lambda) ^ - 1

# Print probability response takes 3-4 hours
print(expon.cdf(4, scale=2.5) - expon.cdf(3, scale=2.5))
